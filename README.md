# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. Aim for about 250 characters.  
For example: "Smart Waste Sorter leverages computer vision and deep learning to classify waste materials quickly. Building AI course project."  

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

* Problem 1: Inefficient waste sorting leads to high recycling costs.
* Problem 2: Manual sorting is labor intensive and error prone.
* Personal motivation: Passion for environmental sustainability and innovative AI solutions.

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using your solution. Consider these points:  
- In what environment or conditions will it be used?  
- Who will be the end users?  
- What are their key needs?

For example, "This solution will be deployed at recycling facilities where robots equipped with cameras classify waste. Operators will monitor the system via a dashboard to ensure smooth operation."

## Data sources and AI methods

What data does your project depend on? For example, data from sensors, images, or online sources.  
Which AI techniques will you use (e.g., deep learning, regression, clustering)?

For example:  
- Data: Video stream from sorting line cameras, metadata from waste bins.
- Techniques: Convolutional neural networks for image classification and computer vision algorithms.

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? List its limitations and any ethical considerations.  
For example: "The project does not address extreme cases of waste contamination. It might also face challenges in varying lighting conditions."

## What next?

How could your project grow and become even more impactful?  
For example: "Future work could integrate real-time analytics, enable remote control during anomalies, or expand the system to multiple sorting facilities. I may need partnerships with waste management companies and further data collection."
